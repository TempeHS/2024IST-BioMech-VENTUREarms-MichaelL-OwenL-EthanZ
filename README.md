# VENTUREarms
![Pictorial](.workingDocuments/Pictorial.jpg)

We intend to create a prosthetic arm for David, who has dreams of becoming a chess master. The prosthetic arm that I will design will be able to pick up the chess pieces and put them down smoothly without wasting any time. This will help David stay speedy while also being able to place down the pieces with precision.Â
