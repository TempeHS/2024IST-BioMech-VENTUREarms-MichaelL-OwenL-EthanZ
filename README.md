# What we intend to create
We intend to create a prosthetic arm for David, who has dreams of becoming a chess master. The prosthetic arm that I will design will be able to pick up the chess pieces and put them down smoothly without wasting any time. This will help David stay speedy while also being able to place down the pieces with precision. 

# How it works 
Our plan is to create a small claw, kind of like the ones that you see in the arcade machines. On the end of each of the claw fingers, we will put some small cut up sponges. This will help the claw grip the chess piece so that they don't slip out. This claw will be able to open and close on command. we will do this by putting an Ultrasonic sensor in the palm of the claw. When the Ultrasonic sensor gets in range of the chess piece, it will send a signal to the Servo motor, which will turn 180o. Attached to this Servo motor will be a piece of string. The string will run through each of the claw fingers and when the servo motor moves, the claws will close onto the chess piece.
